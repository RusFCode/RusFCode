### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Clearings Measurement for Hitachi Energy
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Arduino to python, and App making
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: filipperusso2000@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: Rose are red, violet are blue et you you are readind this

--> In the code right here there are some references to personal path and documents in my pc so don't copy paste or it won't work!
--> I can give you a compiled version if needed
--> Please don't steal this code this is an intellectual property protected by Hitachi energy who's a multinational compagny
--> Stealing this code can expose yourself to severe sanctions in the martial court
